Four different approaches for solving NP-Complete Light Up Puzzles:

Random Search
Evolutionary Algorithm Search
Constraint-Satisfaction EA Search
Multi-Objective EA Search

## Running the code

You can compile & run the code for each approach by using the given run.sh script

Just as a warning, executing the code for the Constraint-Satisfaction EA Search & Multi-Objective EA Search will end up taking upwards of 30 minutes
